A Computer Vision based product that converts handwritten text to digital font using OpenCV and Google Cloud Vision OCR and API tools


Problem:

78% of students read course materials/study with a device
Up from 48% in 2011, likely to increase
Joint study from Princeton and UCLA showed that more information is retained if notes are taken by hand
Digital note takers are more likely to copy verbatim, notes taken by hand are summaries


Solution:

A simple, compact device that translates written text into digital font
Students now have access to the flexibility of handwriting while maintaining the ease of access digital text provides!
